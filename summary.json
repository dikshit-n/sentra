  "summary": " Here is a 2 paragraph summary report of the AWS Security Hub findings:\n\nThe overall risk level presented by these findings is Medium. Of the 10 findings listed, 4 have a severity of Medium and are marked as NEW, indicating they require remediation. The remaining findings are either Informational or have already been RESOLVED. The most common vulnerability identified is that IAM user access keys are not being rotated frequently enough, within 90 days or less, as recommended by the NIST 800-53 and CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark standards. \n\nTo address this, I recommend reviewing all IAM users to ensure their access keys are configured to automatically rotate at least every 90 days. For any users that have keys exceeding 90 days old, those keys should be revoked and new keys generated immediately. Continued monitoring of IAM users and access keys through Security Hub is also advised to help identify any new issues early and ensure compliance with identity and access management best practices.",
